# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard


## The Challenge:

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. 

Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.


## Technology Stacks:
- OpenWeatherMap API
    - [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)

- Bootstrap
- Custom CSS


## Project Conduction:
As a traveler I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so I can plan a trip accordingly.


## Acceptance Criteria:
- When a user engages with the weather dashboard: 
    - They are prompted with form inputs to search for a city.
    - They are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. (localStorage)

- When the user views current weather conditions for that city, they are presented with:
    - City Name 
    - The Date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Wind speed

- When the user views future weather conditions for that city, they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the following: 
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - Temperature
    - Wind speed
    - Humidity

- When the user clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.



## Mock-Up:
